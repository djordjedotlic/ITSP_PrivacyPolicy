IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, CONTACT US FOR A REFUND WITHIN 72 HOURS OF PURCHASE AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.
This Agreement for Microsoft Services (the “agreement”)is entered into by and between the entity ordering the services (“you”, “your” or “customer”) and the closest Microsoft affiliate located in your country or region, unless we designate otherwise in Section 9 below(“we,” “us,” or “our”). “Affiliate” means any legal entity that you or we own, which owns you or us, or which is under common ownership with you or us. “Ownership” means more than 50% ownership.
Terms and Conditions
1. SERVICES.
We agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the services you purchase as described on the services Web site (otherwise known as the “customer services guide”). The Web site URL for the customer services guide is: http://support.microsoft.com. If the URL changes for any reason, we will provide the new URL to you upon your request.
Your use of the services is governed by this agreement and the customer services guide, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this agreement. In the event of a conflict between this agreement and the customer services guide, this agreement will apply.
Our ability to deliver the services depends upon your full and timely cooperation, as well as the accuracy and completeness of any information you provide.
2. OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE.
a. Fixes. We grant you a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up license to use and reproduce the fix we or our designee deliver to you for your internal use only. Fixes are not for resale or distribution to unaffiliated third parties. Except as otherwise provided herein, the license rights granted to fixes are governed by the license agreement for the affected product or, if the fix is not provided for a specific product, any other use terms we provide. Your use of the product is governed by the license agreement for the product. You are responsible for paying any product licensing fees. “Product(s)” means any computer code, web-based services or materials comprising commercially released, pre-release or beta products (whether licensed for a fee or no charge) and any derivatives of the foregoing we or our designee make available to you for license which is published by us, our affiliates or a third-party. “Fixes” means product fixes that we either release generally (such as commercial product service packs) or that we or our designee provide to you when performing services (such as workarounds, patches, hot-fixes, updates, bug fixes, beta fixes and beta builds) and any derivatives of the foregoing. You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, change the file name of or combine with any non-Microsoft computer code any fixes delivered to you.
b. Pre-Existing Work. All rights in any computer code or non-code based written materials “materials”) developed or otherwise obtained by or for us or our affiliates, or you or your affiliates independent of this agreement (“pre-existing work”) shall remain the sole property of the party providing the pre-existing work. During the performance of the services, each party grants to the other party (and our contractors as necessary) a temporary, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce and modify any of its pre-existing work provided solely for the performance of services. We grant you a non exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up license to use, reproduce and modify (if applicable) our pre-existing work, excluding products, in the form delivered to you that we leave with you at the conclusion of our performance of services for use with any developments (if applicable). The license rights granted to our pre-existing work are limited to your internal use only and are ot for resale or distribution to unaffiliated third-parties
c. Developments. We grant you a non-exclusive, perpetual right to use, reproduce and modify any computer code or materials (except for fixes or pre-existing work) that we leave with you at the conclusion of our performance of the services (“developments”) for your internal business operations only. Developments are not for resale or distribution to unaffiliated third parties.
d. Sample Code. In addition to the rights set out in the Developments section above, you are also granted a non-exclusive, perpetual right to reproduce and distribute the object code form of any computer code, provided by us for the purpose of illustration (“sample code”) provided that you agree:
* (i) not to use our name, logo, or trademarks to market your computer product in which the sample code is embedded;
* (ii) to include a valid copyright notice on your computer product in which the sample code is embedded;
* and (iii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend us and our suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys’ fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of the sample code.
e. Open Source License Restrictions. Because certain third party license terms require that computer code be generally
* (i) disclosed in source code form to third parties;
* (ii) licensed to third parties for the purpose of making derivative works;
* or (iii) redistributable to third parties at no charge (collectively, “open source license terms”), the license rights that each party has granted to any computer code (or any intellectual property associated therewith) do no include any license, right, power or authority to incorporate, modify, combine and/or distribute that computer code with any other computer code in a manner which would subject the other’s computer code to open source license terms.
Furthermore, each party warrants that it will not provide or give to the other party computer code that is governed by open source license terms.
f. Affiliates Rights. You may sublicense the rights contained in this section to your affiliates, but your affiliates may not sub-license these rights and your affiliates’ use must be consistent with these license terms contained herein.
* g. Reservation of rights. All rights not expressly granted in this section are reserved.
3. CONFIDENTIALITY.
The terms and conditions of this agreement are confidential, and any and all information identified by either party as “confidential” and/or “proprietary”, or which, under all of the circumstances, ought reasonably to be treated as confidential and/or proprietary (confidential information), will not be disclosed by the receiving party to any third person without the express consent of the other party except under the terms of this agreement for five (5) years following the date of its disclosure. These confidentiality obligations shall not apply to any information which,
* (i) became known to receiving party from a source other than disclosing party other than by the breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to disclosing party,
* (ii) is, or becomes, available to the general public other than through a breach by the receiving party,
* or (iii) is developed through the independent efforts of the receiving party.
We may disclose your confidential information to our consultants or subcontractors only on a need-to-know basis to further the purposes of the agreement and subject to the confidentiality obligations imposed here. We may use any technical information we derive from providing services related to our products for problem resolution, troubleshooting, product functionality enhancements and fixes, and for our knowledge base. We agree not to identify you or disclose any of your confidential information in any item in the knowledge base.
4. WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMER.
a. NO WARRANTY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY CONDITION OR QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SERVICES, OR OTHER MATERIALS OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US.
b. Application of local laws. If applicable law gives you any implied terms, despite the exclusions and limitations in this agreement, then to the extent permitted by applicable law, your remedies are limited as determined by us, in the case of services to either
* (i) re-supply of the services
* or (ii) the cost of the re-supply of the services (if any), and in the case of goods to either
* (i) replacement of the goods
* or (ii) correction of defects in the goods.
The order in which these limited remedies are provided will be determined by us.
5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, EXCLUSIONS.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW:
* 1) OUR TOTAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE SERVICES REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR YOUR CLAIM;
* 2) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR INFORMATION WE PROVIDE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF SUCH POSSIBILITY WAS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE,
* AND 3) IN THE EVENT SERVICES OR ANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU WILL NOT EXCEED US$5.00 OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN LOCAL CURRENCY. THIS EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY TO EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR VIOLATION OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATION, THE OTHER PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR IN THE EVENT OF FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THAT PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY.
6. TAXES.
The amounts to be paid to us under this agreement do not include any foreign, U.S. federal, state, provincial, local, municipal or other governmental taxes (including without limitation any applicable value added, or sales or use taxes) that are owed by you solely as a result of entering into this agreement. We are not liable for any taxes that you are legally obligated to pay. All such taxes (including but not limited to net income or gross receipts taxes, franchise taxes, and/or property taxes) shall be your financial responsibility.
7. TERMINATION.
Either party may terminate this agreement if the other party is
* (i) in material breach or default of any obligation that is not cured within 30 calendar days notice of such breach
* or (ii) fails to pay any invoice that is more than 60 calendar days outstanding.
You agree to pay all fees for services performed and expenses incurred.
8. MISCELLANEOUS.
This agreement constitutes the parties’ entire agreement concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any other prior and contemporaneous communications. All notices, authorizations, and requests given or made in connection with this agreement must be sent by post, express courier, or facsimile to the addresses indicated by both parties. Notices will be deemed delivered on the date shown on the postal return receipt or on the courier, or facsimile confirmation of delivery. You may not assign this agreement without our written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. You and we agree to comply with all international and national laws that apply to this agreement. This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington if the services were purchased in the United States, the laws of Ireland if purchased in any country or region in Europe, Middle East or Africa (“EMEA”), or the laws of the jurisdiction where the affiliate delivering the services is located if purchased outside the United States or EMEA. Any action brought under this agreement shall be brought in federal or state court in the State of Washington if the services were purchased in the United States, the courts of Ireland if the services were purchased in any country or region in EMEA, or the courts of the jurisdiction where the affiliate delivering the services is located if purchased outside the United States or EMEA. Notwithstanding, this does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations in any appropriate jurisdiction. The sections regarding restrictions on use, fees, confidentiality, ownership and license, no other warranties, limitations of liability, termination, and miscellaneous of this agreement, will survive any termination or expiration of this agreement. If a court holds any provision of this agreement to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the parties will amend the agreement to give effect to the stricken clause to the maximum extent possible. No waiver of any breach of this agreement will be a waiver of any other breach, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. Apart from the payment of any amounts due, neither party shall be liable for performance delays or for non performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control. It is the express wish of the parties that this agreement be drawn up in English. C’est la volonté exprèsse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.

As a result, Etsy has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. Etsy does not pre-screen users (except for services that require an application) or the content or information provided by users. Etsy cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.
Consequently, Etsy does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
Etsy cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. Etsy encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.
You agree that Etsy is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on Etsy. You use the Etsy service at your own risk.
2. Membership Eligibility
Age: Etsy's services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. Etsy may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer access to or use of the Site to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Site is revoked in such jurisdictions.
Individuals under the age of 18 must at all times use Etsy's services only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age. In all cases, the adult is the user and is responsible for any and all activities.
Compliance: You agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content. You are responsible for all applicable taxes. In addition, you must abide by Etsy's policies as stated in the Agreement and the Etsy policy documents listed below (if applicable to your activities on or use of the Site) as well as all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site by Etsy, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and each of which may be updated by Etsy from time to time without notice to you:
* Fees Policy
* Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy
* Direct Checkout Terms of Use
* Referral Terms and Conditions
* Affiliates Program Terms of Use
In addition, some services offered through the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Etsy from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.
Password: Keep your password secure. You are fully responsible for all activity, liability and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify Etsy of any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security. You also agree that Etsy cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure. You agree not to provide your username and password information in combination to any other party other than Etsy without Etsy's express written permission.
Account Information: You must keep your account information up-to-date and accurate at all times, including a valid email address. To sell items on Etsy you must provide and maintain valid payment information such as valid credit card information or a valid PayPal account.
Account Transfer: You may not transfer or sell your Etsy account and User ID to another party. You are responsible for all activity of the account and User ID. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement.
Right to Refuse Service: Etsy's services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely suspended Etsy members. Etsy reserves the right, in Etsy's sole discretion, to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts. Etsy reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason, at any time.
3. Fees and Billing
Joining and setting up a shop on Etsy is free (excluding additional sales channels on Etsy that may have separate fees). Etsy charges fees for listing an item for sale, as well as a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Etsy's Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Etsy's services are effective after Etsy provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. However, Etsy may choose to temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for Etsy's services for promotional events (for example, free listing days); such changes are effective when Etsy posts the temporary promotional event on the Site. Etsy may, at Etsy's sole discretion, change some or all of Etsy's services at any time. In the event Etsy introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD).
In certain situations, including but not limited to a void or invalid transaction, Etsy may issue a credit for the applicable fees to a seller's billing statement.
You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using Etsy. Etsy provides plans for both automatic and manual bill payment as outlined in Etsy’s Billing Policy. Etsy will send an invoice to the seller’s email address on file detailing the amount due for the prior month’s fees and charges. The seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the date of the invoice, or the account will be considered past due.
Fees and Termination: If Etsy terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Etsy fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Etsy for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Etsy.
4. Listing and Selling
Listing Description: All listings on Etsy must be for sale. By listing an item on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Etsy's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your Etsy shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the in stock quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing.
Shop Policies: All sellers are urged to outline shop policies for their Etsy shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling policies. Sellers must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies must comply with Etsy's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. Etsy reserves the right to request that a seller modify a shop policy.
Binding Sale: Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items, and buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.
Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Etsy transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission.
5. Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Items and Activities
You are solely responsible for your conduct and activities on and regarding to Etsy and any and all data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links (together, Content) that you submit, post, and display on Etsy.

* Link directly or indirectly, reference or contain descriptions of goods or services that are prohibited under this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, Etsy Guidelines, or other policy documents as posted on Etsy.
Furthermore, you may not list any item on Etsy (or consummate any transaction that was initiated using Etsy's service) that, by paying to Etsy the listing fee or the final value fee, could cause Etsy to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or that violates the Terms of Use.
6. Content
License: Etsy does not claim ownership rights in your Content. You grant Etsy a license solely to enable Etsy to use any information or Content you supply Etsy with, so that Etsy is not violating any rights you might have in that Content. You grant Etsy a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise the copyright, publicity, and database rights (but no other rights) you have in the Content, in any media now known or not currently known, with respect to your Content. You agree to allow Etsy to store, translate, or re-format your Content on Etsy and display your Content on Etsy in any way Etsy chooses. Etsy will only use personal information in accordance with Etsy's Privacy Policy.
As part of a transaction, you may obtain personal information, including email address and shipping information, from another Etsy user. Without obtaining prior permission from the other user, this personal information shall only be used for that transaction or for Etsy-related communications. Etsy has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Etsy user to your email or physical mail list. For more information, see Etsy's Privacy Policy.
Re-Posting Content: By posting Content on Etsy, it is possible for an outside website or a third party to re-post that Content. You agree to hold Etsy harmless for any dispute concerning this use. If you choose to display your own Etsy-hosted image on another website, the image must provide a link back to its listing page on Etsy.
Idea Submissions: Etsy considers any unsolicited suggestions, ideas, proposals or other material submitted to it by users via the Site or otherwise (other than the Content and the tangible items sold on the Site by users) (collectively, the Material) to be non-confidential and non-proprietary, and Etsy shall not be liable for the disclosure or use of such Material. If, at Etsy's request, any member sends Material to improve the site (for example through the Forums or to customer support), Etsy will also consider that Material to be non-confidential and non-proprietary and Etsy will not be liable for use or disclosure of the Material. Any communication by you to Etsy is subject to this Agreement. You hereby grant and agree to grant Etsy, under all of your rights in the Material, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid, sublicensable and transferable right and license to incorporate, use, publish and exploit such Material for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including but not limited to incorporating it in the API, documentation, or any product or service, without compensation or accounting to you and without further recourse by you.
7. Information Control
Etsy does not control the Content provided by users that is made available on Etsy. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. There are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense.
Additionally, there may also be risks dealing with international trade and foreign nationals. By using Etsy, you agree to accept such risks and that Etsy (and Etsy's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of users on Etsy. Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe buying and selling when using Etsy.
Other Resources: Etsy is not responsible for the availability of outside websites or resources linked to or referenced on the Site. Etsy does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such websites or resources. You agree that Etsy shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or resources.
8. Meetings
Users may arrange and attend online virtual meetings or in-person meetings (Meetings) with one or more individuals. Users are solely responsible for interactions with others. Users must comply with Etsy's policies and acknowledge and agree to comply with the laws of the city, county and country in which the Meeting occurs. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular group or Meeting may be set by the group's contact person. Etsy is not involved with user generated groups, the groups' requirements, or the Meetings.
Etsy does not supervise or control the Meetings, user-initiated online or offline gatherings, or the interactions among and between users and other persons or companies. Users are solely responsible for interactions with others. Users understand that Etsy does not in any way screen its users. All users agree to exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others, particularly if meeting offline or in person.
Groups or User Fees: Some user-generated groups on Etsy may require or request that users pay fees in order to be a member of the group, participate in a promotion, or participate in Meetings. ETSY IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTIONS, THE PAYMENTS OR THEIR PROCESSING. THE PAYMENT DOES NOT GO TO ETSY; THIS MONEY IS SEPARATE FROM ANY FEES OR CHARGES ASSESSED BY ETSY, AND ETSY HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE MONEY, THE USER-GENERATED GROUPS, PROMOTIONS, THE MEETINGS, OR THE LEADER OF THE GROUP IN CONNECTION WITH ITS USE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ETSY IS NEITHER INVOLVED NOR A PARTY IN ANY PAYMENT, TRANSACTION OR INTERACTION BETWEEN OR AMONG USER-GENERATED GROUPS, ETSY USERS AND/OR THIRD PARTIES (together a Third Party Transaction), AND THAT YOU BEAR ALL RISK IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY TRANSACTIONS. Users should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to contribute money.
9. Resolution of Disputes and Release
Disputes with Etsy: In the event a dispute arises between you and Etsy, please contact Etsy. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York County, New York, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts or state courts located in the Southern District of New York. Use of the Site is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including without limitation, this section. You and Etsy agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Site (including, but not limited to, any services provided or made available therein) or this Agreement must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
Disputes with Users or Third Parties: In the event a dispute arises between you and another user or a third party, Etsy encourages you to contact the user or third party to resolve the dispute amicably.
If a buyer and seller are unable to resolve a dispute resulting from a transaction that occurs on Etsy, they may choose to participate in Etsy’s case system in order to resolve the dispute. Cases are escalated for review and resolution by Etsy. Etsy provides its dispute resolution process for the benefit of users. Etsy does so in Etsy's sole discretion, and Etsy has no obligation to resolve disputes between users or between users and outside parties. To the extent that Etsy attempts to resolve a dispute, Etsy will do so in good faith based solely on Etsy's policies. Etsy will not make judgments regarding legal issues or claims.
You may also report user-to-user disputes to your local law enforcement, postmaster general, or a certified mediation or arbitration entity, as applicable.
You release Etsy (and Etsy's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with disputes with one or more users, or an outside party.

Miami police officer Marcel Jackson pulled over a speeder as his personal GoPro camera rolled and was involved in a brawl with a man he didn't realize was a superior officer working with Internal Affairs. Jackson said he was just doing his job but the officer was 'trying to pull rank' and acted aggressively when pulled over. Jackson approached the car and the door suddenly flung open and the man stepped out and appeared to argue with him. When the interaction turned physical, Jackson flung the man to the ground before learning he was Lieutenant David Ramras.

It seems that one Comcast rep has decided on a brilliant new way to retain customers - never let them leave. That would most likely be confirmed by Ryan Block, the co-founder of tech site Engadget (pictured), who found himself enduring a torturous 18 minute interrogation of a phone call with a barking Comcast employee who demanded to know why he wanted to choose another cable provider. Comcast subsequently apologized for the incident (tweet pictured bottom).

Actress and former Miss America Vanessa Williams has spoken out about being molested by an 18-year-old girl when she was only 10-years-old. Williams says that the incident sexualized her at an innappropriately early age and that in a way it took away some of her innocence. 'It awakens your sexuality at an age where it shouldn't be awakened,' said Williams.

The three Connecticut millennials charged with causing a disturbance at the singer's Rhode Island mansion are anything but your average vandals. The trio - Michael Horrigan, 29, his roommate Tristan Kading, 28, (above left) and his sister Emily Kading, 26 (above center) - pleaded not guilty this week to hurling beer bottles and shouted expletives at security officers patrolling the star's seaside property. However it has now been revealed they are all well-to-do twenty-somethings, who claim they were 'just drinking and it got out of hand'. Tristan Kading studied chemical oceanography, graduating from MIT, while sister Emily Kading is a nuclear scientist studying to be a nuclear physicist. Both Tristan and Michael Horrigan have been given citations for heroism after saving a 12-year-old girl after her canoe capsized.

The venomous letter personally attacked Wilson's fiancee for not being the hero she believes him to be and then frightened her when it finished up by calling her lucky because 'I didn't slash your damn tires!'.

Robert Smith, 24, from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire was diagnosed with proteus syndrome, a rare illness which causes the abnormal growth of a person's bones, skin and head. He passed away at his home, despite his mother Rita's desperate attempts to save her only son. She said: 'I can't believe he has gone... I'm devastated. I don't know what I'll do without him.' Mrs Smith, 66, was warned her son would not live beyond one month when he was born four weeks premature at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn, Norfolk. He was treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital for hydrocephalus - a build up of fluid on the brain. By the age of two Robert had eight shunts fitted to drain the fluid and at 16 doctors diagnosed him with proteus syndrome. He weighed 19 stone, had size 16 feet and a 40-inch inside leg, and underwent a staggering 74 operations in his lifetime.

The new self-serve beer stations at Minnesota's Target Field might herald the future of stadium concessions - but they are hardly the most incredible food or drink options available nationwide.

Someone somewhere is now the proud owner of a rare American Sherman tank after paying $299,000 for it this weekend at an auction of more than 100 tanks and military vehicles amassed by a Silicon Valley tycoon. Jacques Littlefield's collection, one of the nation's most extensive and historic, was sold in the San Francisco Bay Area during one of the largest-ever auctions of military vehicles (including a Scud missile, top left and a British Rapier missile system, top right). Bidders from 10 countries and 37 U.S. states bought nearly all of the 122 military vehicles - some of which are operational and require a federal permit to own - on auction, generating $10.24 million in sales, according to Auctions America, which ran the auction on Friday and Saturday, on behalf of the Collings Foundation.

Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy
Etsy, Inc. (Etsy) has adopted the following general policy toward copyright and intellectual property infringement in accordance with general U.S. intellectual property laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf). Etsy will respond to notices of this form from jurisdictions other than the U.S. as well. The address of Etsy's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (Designated Agent) is listed at the end of this policy.
Etsy may act expeditiously to respond to a proper notice by (1) removing or disabling access to material claimed to be subject of infringing activity; and (2) removing and discontinuing service to repeat offenders. If Etsy removes or disables access in response to such a notice, Etsy will make a good-faith attempt to contact the allegedly infringing party (Member) so that they may make a counter notification.
A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright or Intellectual Property Infringements:
If you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your intellectual property, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees). Therefore, if you are not sure whether the material infringes upon your intellectual property, please contact an attorney before contacting Etsy.
If you believe that material residing on or accessible through the Etsy web site or service infringes a copyright or other intellectual property right, to provide Etsy of notice of such infringement, you may send a notice of infringement to the Designated Agent listed below (preferably via email to legal@etsy.com). Please specify the type of infringement at issue and the notice must include the following information:
* A signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or intellectual property right that has been allegedly infringed upon (signatures may be provided electronically by typing your name);
* Identification in sufficient detail of the material being infringed upon (for an allegation of a patent infringement, please provide a patent number);
* Identification of the material on Etsy that is claimed to be infringing upon the intellectual property. Include information regarding the location of the infringing material with sufficient detail so that Etsy is capable of finding and verifying its existence (for listings, please provide the link or URL to each listing you allege is infringing);
* Contact information about the notifier including the name of the intellectual property owner, the name and title of the person contacting Etsy on the owner's behalf, the address, telephone number and email address;
* A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the intellectual property or copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the intellectual property or copyright owner.
When removing material from the site, Etsy will make reasonable attempts to inform the Member of the removal, the reason for the removal, and may provide the Member with a copy of the notice and the notifying party’s contact information.
B. Removal of Allegedly Infringing Material
Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is received by the Designated Agent, Etsy may remove or disable access to the material infringing upon the intellectual property. If Etsy removes or disables access to content in response to an infringement notice, Etsy will make reasonable attempts to notify the Member that Etsy has removed or disabled access to the material. Repeat offenders will have all material removed from the system and Etsy will terminate such Members’ access to the service.
C. Procedure to Supply a Copyright Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:
If you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is not infringing upon the intellectual property, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees). Therefore, if you are not sure whether or not the material infringes on the intellectual property, please contact an attorney before contacting Etsy.
If a Member believes that their material that was removed or to which access was disabled is not infringing upon a copyright, you may send a counter-notice, pursuant to 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Please do not re-list or reactivate the material yourself. The counter-notice must contain the following information to the Designated Agent listed below.
* Your signature (signatures may be provided electronically by typing your name);
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
* A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material;
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the Member’s address is located, or if your address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Etsy is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Etsy may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Etsy may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright or intellectual property owner files an action seeking a court order against the Member, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days after receipt of the counter-notice, at Etsy’s discretion.
Please contact Etsy’s Designated Agent to submit Notifications of Claimed Infringement and Copyright Counter-Notices by email: legal@etsy.com (preferred), or at the following address:
Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement:
Etsy, Inc.
Attn: Legal Department
55 Washington Street Suite 512
Brooklyn, NY 11201

How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps
Many websites use Google technologies to improve their content and keep it free. When you visit a website that uses our advertising products (like AdSense), social products (like the +1 button) or analytics tools (Google Analytics), your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes, for example, the web address of the page that you're visiting and your IP address. We may also set cookies on your browser, or read cookies that are already there.
Similarly, apps that partner with Google can send us information such as the name of the app and an identifier that helps us to determine which ads we've served to other apps on your device.
How we use the information sent by your browser
When you visit websites or use apps that use Google technologies, we may use the information we receive from those websites and apps to, for example:
* Make ads more effective
* Provide reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads, and to ensure payment to those website publishers
* Help website and app owners using Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
* Improve your Google+ experience
* Detect and defend against fraud and other security risks to protect users and partners
* Meet our legal duties
* Improve our products
How you can control the information sent to Google
For tips and advice on staying safe and managing your data online, visit the Google Safety Center.
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your web browser when you visit or interact with Google services on partners' sites across the web:
* Ads Settings helps you control the ads by Google that you see across the web. You can learn how ads are selected for you, opt out of certain categories and block specific advertisers. Learn more about advertising.
* Many sites across the web use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on. Learn more about Google Analytics and privacy.
* Google makes it easy for you to make recommendations for your friends - for example, by clicking the +1 button on content you like. Some of your +1s may show your name and Google+ profile photo in ads, but you can opt out if you don't want to appear in ads. You can also visit the +1 tab on your Google+ profile to review and manage all of your +1's. Learn more about how to get to your +1 tab.
* Incognito mode in Chrome allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser history. Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about cookies.

Facts: WHAT DOES CHASE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?
Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
What?
The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:
* Social Security Number and income
* account balances and transaction history
* credit history and payment history
How?
All financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers' personal information; the reasons Chase chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
Reasons we can
share your personal
information
Does Chase
Share?
Can you limit
this sharing?
For our everyday business purposes – such as process your transactions, maintain your account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus
Yes  No
For our marketing purposes – to offer our products and services to you
For joint marketing with other financial companies
For our affiliates' everyday business purposes – information about your transactions and experiences

Please note:
If you are a new customer, we can begin sharing your information 30 days from the date we sent this notice. When you are no longer our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.
However, you can contact us at any time to limit our sharing.
Questions?
Call 1–888–868–8618
Who we are
Who is providing this notice?
The JPMorgan Chase & Co. family of companies. A partial list of its U.S. consumer financial companies is located at the end of this document.
What we do
How does Chase
protect my personal
information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We authorize our employees to get your information only when they need it to do their work, and we require companies that work for us to protect your information.
How does Chase collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
* open an account or make deposits or withdrawals from your account
* pay your bills or apply for a loan
* use your credit or debit card
We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.
Why can't I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
* sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes – information about your creditworthiness
* affiliates from using your information to market to you
* sharing for non affiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
See below for more on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing
for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.
Affiliates
Companies related by common ownership or control. They can be financial and non financial companies.
* Our affiliates include companies with a Chase or JPMorgan name and financial companies such as J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.
Non affiliates

* Non affiliates we share with can include companies such as retailers, auto dealers, auto makers and membership clubs

* Our joint marketing partners include categories of companies such as insurance companies

It makes total mainstream comedy sense to reunite Bad Teacher, the gym teacher who ultimately wooed her, and their director in a new movie that steers an R-rated course through married life and a couple's attempt to spice it up. We don't think the movie will reach the same box-office heights as Neighbors, but Cameron Diaz just worked The Other Woman into a huge success and the big screen has been surprisingly Segel-free for the most part, so we think word-of-mouth will keep the movie going after a successful opening weekend.
Some of us might hope for a world where Hollywood could not make any sequels for one year, but when your dystopian nightmare thriller thingy grosses over $60 million on a reported production budget of under $5 million, simple economics are going to keep this franchise going for at least another installment. The best things we see here are Michael K. Williams in the cast and Frank Grillo getting a starring role; he was just case in the remake of The Raid as well.
The world above Cars expands, even if most kids see this for the first time from the backseat of the minivan.
There has to be a fair amount of pressure on Zach Braff to deliver the goods after his high-profile crowdsourcing for his new project, which arrives a full decade after Garden State. It's the kind of scenario that movie critics will prey upon. Our main question is: isn't 35 a touch early for a mid-life crisis?
Filmmaker Daniel Lusko has an Asylum/Syfy movie to his credit alongside a handful of political/religious endeavors, and his latest looks like a fire-starter ready to be embraced by conservatives and admonished by not just liberals. This is definitely James Remar's most curious appearance since he played two minor characters in Django Unchained.
We like Brit Marling quite a bit but more so when she works with her other go-to collaborator, Zal Batmanglij, with whom she has made The East and Sound of My Voice. With Mike Cahill she's has made her dippy-science movie, Another Earth, whose script felt like it was written on rolling papers. And now this. Interesting to see her Earth co-star William Mapother back in a supporting role.
Michel Gondry has assembled some of the top French film stars into a single project that continues to keep him out of the studio system that almost crushed his creative spirit after making The Green Hornet. Have we ever seen him so romantic before?
This personal and politicized documentary reinforces the fact that we've always been leery of people who do not have a direct connection with music in any form.

If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, you will receive a notice via email. Unless you explain or correct your behavior within 72 hours, your account will be suspended. We will do our best to work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases. We reserve the right to immediately suspend, without notice, any content, account, or IP address which we determine to be submitting spam or other potentially damaging or disruptive content to the Network.
When your account is suspended, public access to content contributed under that account may be blocked or removed, and your account may be suspended or deleted at our discretion. Access to other functionality or information within the Network may also be blocked or disabled.
Illegal Use. Stack Exchange may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this include using Stack Exchange for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information).

Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel. Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement.
Disruptions and Exploits. We will terminate accounts and block addresses of those who attempt unauthorized use of the Stack Exchange Network.
Copyright. Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases.

We will work to note your request promptly, but your request may take up to twelve weeks to be fully effective for mail campaigns. Because promotions from our affiliates or Affinity Partners are developed weeks and months in advance, you may sometimes receive solicitations if the promotion has already been implemented.
If you elect not to receive direct marketing offers by postal mail, telephone and/or e-mail, please note that we may continue to contact you as necessary to service your account, which may include being contacted by your assigned account representative (for example, Financial Advisor or relationship manager), if applicable, and for other nonmarketing purposes. Bank of America may also continue to provide marketing information in your regular account mailings and statements, including online and ATM communications.
* Show What is the five-year opt out language?
When you opt out of direct marketing by mail or telephone, your opt out(s) will last for five years, subject to applicable law. After that, you can choose to renew your opt out(s) for another five-year period.
* Show Does this five-year expiration apply also to opt outs from third party or affiliate sharing?
No, this applies only to the direct marketing opt out for mail or phone contacts.
* Show How will I know when my Bank of America Do Not Call or Do Not Mail choice expires?
If you have informed us prior to January 1, 2007 of your choice not to receive marketing solicitations by phone or mail, we will provide notification prior to the expiration of a choice along with information on how to renew a choice. If you informed us after January 1, 2007, your telephone and postal mail opt-out choices will last for five years, subject to applicable law.
* Show How do I get on your do not mail, do not phone or do not email list?
To tell us your choices:
* Notify us at www.bankofamerica.com/privacy and entering the information on a secure Web site;
* Show Will I continue to receive direct mail solicitations that contain access checks with low promotional interest rate offers if I process a privacy choice to not receive mail?
Opting out of direct mail marketing offers will not prevent you from receiving promotional interest rate offers in the mail if you qualify. If you would like to be removed from receiving these offers in the mail, you can call the toll-free number on the back of your credit card and inform the customer representative that you would like to be added to the cease access checks opt-out list.
* Show Can a business opt out of direct marketing?
No, direct marketing choices, with the exception of e-mail, apply to individuals, not businesses.
* Show What will Bank of America try to sell me over the phone?
To minimize the amount of telephone solicitation our customers receive, we do not offer nonfinancial products and services through telephone solicitations.

How can we help you?
Etsy's Trademark Guidelines
We here at Etsy™ support and encourage ideas, services, and tools that use and supplement the Etsy services; however, we are also serious about protecting our reputation and brand identity. To help us achieve this goal, we have created these guidelines to help Etsy members, Etsy Teams, and others refer to us or our services without compromising the strength of our trademarks or our brand identity. In other words, these guidelines only concern the use of Etsy’s intellectual property (for example, the use of the term “Etsy”). For issues regarding any intellectual property which is not exclusively owned by Etsy, Inc. please refer to Etsy’s Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy.
Trademark Basics
A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device (or a combination thereof) that identifies the goods or services of a person or company and distinguishes them from the goods and services of others. The word “Etsy” and other Etsy graphics, logos, designs, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names (together, the “Etsy Marks”) are registered trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of Etsy, Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries.
Why must Etsy Protect the Etsy Marks? Etsy must be to able assure Internet users and others that only the services offered, sponsored, or endorsed by Etsy actually bear the Etsy Marks. Trademark law requires that we not only protect against improper use of the Etsy Marks, but also protect against the use of confusingly similar marks.
Using the Etsy Marks
In order for you to help us protect the Etsy Marks, we ask the following:
DO:
* Do make fair use of Etsy’s Marks. Etsy supports free speech and you do not need permission to make legitimate commentary about Etsy, the company, or Etsy’s services.
* Do distinguish the Etsy Marks from surrounding text by, for example, capitalizing the first letter of the Etsy Marks.
* Do spell the Etsy Marks properly.
DO NOT:
* Do not say things about Etsy you know are not true.
* Do not incorporate the Etsy Marks or a confusingly similar mark into, for example, the name of your business, organization, non-profit organization, event, or trademark.
* Do not remove, alter, distort or modify the Etsy Marks, including adding other terms to the Etsy Marks to create new words.
* Do not use the Etsy Marks or a confusingly similar mark in a way that falsely implies a relationship or affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by Etsy, Inc. or that can be reasonably interpreted to suggest information comes from, or represents the views or opinions of Etsy, Inc. or an Etsy employee.
* Do not, without prior permission, use the Etsy Marks in a product. Click here for information about applying for a license to use an Etsy Mark in connection with a product.
* Do not use any trademarks, service marks, trade dress, designs or logos that are confusingly similar to the Etsy Marks or the look and feel of the Etsy website.
* Do not use the Etsy Marks in any way or on any website that contains or promotes adult content, gambling, or otherwise violates applicable law or regulation.
* Do not use the Etsy Marks in a manner that is in Etsy’s sole opinion misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, tarnishing, obscene or otherwise objectionable to Etsy.
To help clarify these guidelines, please check out these examples.
Etsy reserves the right to alter these policies at any time.

Adobe and the companies that help us run our business use cookies in several ways, such as:
* Authenticating and identifying you on our websites and applications so we can provide you the services you requested
* Keeping track of information you have provided to us — for example, keeping items in your shopping cart as you browse the Adobe Store
* To provide you the Adobe websites and applications that you use
* Remembering your preferences or where you left off in your use of an Adobe website or application
* Measuring your use of Adobe websites and applications so that we can improve them, tailor our websites and online services to your likely interests, and conduct market research (learn more or opt out)

Technologies Similar to Cookies
Technically speaking, cookies are called “HTTP cookies.” There are other technologies that can be used for similar purposes, such as HTML5 Local Storage and local shared objects (LSOs). LSOs are used by the authors of files that are read by Adobe® Flash® Player and the websites hosting those files (learn more about Flash Player and LSOs). We may use HTML5 Local Storage, LSOs, and similar technologies for authenticating you, keeping track of information you have provided to us, and remembering your preferences (see bullet points above). When you are using an Adobe application offline, we may store information related to how you used that application on your device and then transfer it to our servers the next time you connect online to our service.
Web beacons and embedded scripts
Web beacons and embedded scripts are other technologies that we use in our websites and applications, as well as in some of our emails and ads.
Web beacons (or “tags”) are bits of programming code included in web pages, emails, and ads that notify Adobe (or the companies that help us run our business) when those web pages, emails, or ads have been viewed or clicked on.
Embedded scripts are bits of programming code included within some of our web pages that measure how you use those web pages, such as which links you click. We use this information to improve our websites and online services, tailor our websites and online services to your likely interests, and conduct market research. You may be able to turn off scripting functionality, such as JavaScript, within your browser (please refer to your browser's help function). Note that if you disable scripting functionality, some Adobe websites and applications may not function properly.

Where can I view your current privacy policy?
Why does Pandora need my Postal / Zip Code, Gender, and Birth Year?
Will Pandora send me SPAM?
Opt Out of Pandora Marketing Emails
For our current Privacy Policy, click here
Why does Pandora need my Postal / Zip Code,Gender, and Birth Year?
The free version of Pandora is supported by advertisements, and we want to be able to show the most relevant ads to our listeners.
We use the three pieces of demographic information you provide at registration -- age, gender, and zipcode -- to personalize advertising on Pandora. We do this both on Pandora.com and in our mobile applications. This means we may pass age, gender and zipcode to our ad-serving partners so they can personalize the ads you see. Please note, however, that our advertisers never know who they are serving such ads to -- merely that it is an anonymous person of a particular age, gender, and/or location.
Pandora will never use your email address to send unsolicited messages, nor do we sell your personal information to spammers. The only advertising we display comes in the form of banners on the Pandora site. The only email we send is our opt-in Inside The Genome newsletter. I have removed you from that list.
If you are receiving increased amounts of spam, rest assured that it is not coming from us. Sadly, the techniques that spammers use to harvest addresses are increasingly sinister. I'm not sure that there is any surefire way to completely avoid it. If you have ever posted your email in a public website, message board, guestbook, or blog, you are likely vulnerable. Try to avoid signing up on sites that appear questionable in nature. Many spammers also use brute force techniques by emailing arbitrary strings from a given domain name. Unfortunately, avoiding that can be very difficult.
While prevention is tricky, you can definitely regulate the amount of spam you see. Email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird have built in spam filters that you can train. The more messages you mark as spam, the fewer of them appear. Further, many of the larger online email providers like Hotmail, Gmail, and Yahoo have spam filters built in that work quite well. Be sure to utilize them.
Best of luck, and rest assured – your security and privacy is of our utmost concern.
If you'd like to stop receiving marketing emails from Pandora, sign in to your account, click your email address in the top right corner and select Settings.
Select Notices and uncheck Send me personalized recommendations and tips. You can also email us.
On the iPhone or iPod:
If you'd like to stop receiving marketing emails from Pandora, launch the Pandora app, tap on Settings, then select ‘Notices.’
?Next to ‘Tips,’ toggle the switch to ‘OFF’ to opt out of non-service related emails.
On an Android:
You can disable notices under the Settings section in the app.
Tap on 'Notices' then uncheck the boxes next to the notices you no longer wish to receive, including ‘Tips’ from Pandora or notifications that you have new followers or comments.

An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Google group of companies.
Anonymous identifier
An anonymous identifier is a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in local storage mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions (for example, so that the data are retrievable even after the browser has been closed and reopened). One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookie
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, a device could be a desktop, tablet or smartphone.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password). This account information will be used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or terminate your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
HTTP Referrer
An HTTP Referrer is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that webpage. The HTTP Referrer contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
IP address
Every computer connected to the Internet is assigned a unique number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country from which a computer is connecting to the Internet.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information which you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Google.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies.

Unique device identifier
A unique device identifier is a string of characters that is incorporated into a device by its manufacturer and can be used to uniquely identify that device (for example an IMEI-number of a mobile phone). Different device identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed. A given device may have several different unique device identifiers. Unique device identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as a user’s email inbox, remembering the user’s preferences and providing relevant advertising.

HELP
If you have any queries, problems or comments, there are lots of ways of getting in touch. Whatever the issue, we love to get your feedback, so that we can make your playing experience at Pink Ribbon Bingo the very, very best.
For 24 hour online support
Select the help chat room from within the game, and our staff will assist you.
Start a Game
Click on one of the 'Play Now!' links from the website.
Select the Game
The next game to be played will be displayed detailing the pattern type, card value and time until the game starts. Take note of the pattern and card value, and click if you want to play the game.
Select & Buy Cards
You will be issued 24 randomly generated bingo cards. These are displayed on the screen in batches of six cards at a time. To scroll between all of the 24 cards, use the left and right arrow buttons at the top left of the card display area. The current batch will be displayed in the navigation panel as for example cards 6-12. To select or deselect a card, simply click anywhere on the card. The navigation panel on the right of the screen will display the number of cards you have selected.
If you do not like the cards that have been issued to you, you can click the Get New Cards button at the top of the card display area. This will issue you with new randomly generated unselected cards. You can also have the game automatically select cards for you, to save you clicking and scrolling individual cards. You can auto select 6,12,18,24 or the maximum number of cards allowed. After you are satisfied with your selected cards, click on the Buy Selected Cards button on the navigation panel. This will purchase your selected cards. Please note that purchases are not refundable. Each purchased card will display a card number at the bottom of the card. The navigation panel will display the number of purchased cards you have for the upcoming game.
The top of the screen will display the number of players, jackpot and time until the game begins.
Play Bingo
The screen will warn you that the game is about to begin. The game screen will display your purchased cards in batches of 6 (assuming you purchased more than 6 cards). You can scroll between cards by clicking the left and right arrow buttons located at the top of the card area. The current batch of cards is also displayed as, for example cards 1-6 of 9.
The top of the screen displays the number of people playing and current jackpot of the game.
You can toggle the Show from 3tg (three numbers to go before your card has bingo) by clicking the button at the top of the card display area. When selected, all cards with 3, 2 or 1 number to go will be indicated.
You can toggle the autodauber by clicking the Autodauber button at the top of the card display area. When autodauber is on, the game automatically marks or daubs your card when your numbers are called out. When autodauber is off, your card numbers are not automatically daubed, and you can mark them yourself by clicking the number on the card. Called numbers are daubed in pink if they form part of the required BINGO pattern for the current game.
Please note that whether or not you daub the numbers, and how you daub them has no effect on the game outcome. IF YOU HAVE A WINNING BINGO CARD YOU WILL ALWAYS WIN!
Click the ? button to display this help window.
Fund your account by clicking Banking.
The current game name and pattern is also displayed.
When the game starts, there is a slight pause before the balls are called out.
The balls are drawn in a random order and are displayed at the top right of the screen, accompanied by a voice calling the numbers out.
Remember, you can switch the sound off and on by clicking the sound icon/button.
Each called ball is displayed on the bingo board, and the last 5 calls are displayed to the right.
At the end of the game, BINGO! will be called and the winner(s) aliases are displayed. Your winnings will automatically be added to account when you win.
The game will then either automatically go back to the next game screen after a short time, or after you click OK.
Chatting
Pink Ribbon Bingo is renowned for its fun chat rooms. In the rooms you can talk to other players, ask questions with our chat moderators, play games to earn loyalty points and ultimately meet and make new friends.
The chat window is available from the game selection screen. Click on the Chat button at the lower right of the screen to connect to the Pink Ribbon Bingo chat rooms.
Occasionally some of our players have problems connecting to the chat rooms because their computers are set-up behind firewalls. If you have any trouble connecting please contact us.
The chat system is composed of 3 main areas:
The rooms and message display area;
The control panel and text input area; and
The other chatter's alias area.
The top of the message display window displays the current room you are chatting in. This defaults to the Main Room when you connect initially. Roll over the down arrow at the right of the room you are chatting in and you will see a list of other rooms that are open for chatting. You will also see the number of people talking in each room and you can select the room you want to chat in.
The message window displays the text conversations from the people in your chat room. The alias' of the other people who are also chatting is displayed at the bottom left of the screen. You can mute/un-mute (stop / start) the chatter by clicking on an individual's alias in that window.
To send a chat message, enter the text in the orange send box and press Enter or click the send arrow button. You can also send quick abbreviated messages by clicking on the green abbreviation buttons. Rolling over these buttons will display their meaning in the chat community.
REFRESH will refresh the rooms and players in the chat system. CLEAR will clear the message window. QUIT exits the chat system.
Pink Ribbon Bingo does not tolerate rude or offensive chat and players who violate this rule will be removed from the site.
Instant Games
Pink Ribbon Bingo has recently introduced a few very exciting instant games to play:
Table Games (Blackjack, Roulette etc.)
Video Poker
slots
Instant Win.
These games can be played while you are playing bingo (or in between bingo games). They operate independently of the Bingo software and therefore you can play the instant games SIMULTANEOUSLY with your Bingo game (if you want). The Instant Games are just as safe and fun as Bingo.
You may play the Instant Games at any time from the bingo game just by clicking on the game you want to play. A separate game window will pop-up and you can follow the instructions for that game by selecting the associated help icon within the window.
The games form part of your Bingo Account and any wagers made will be immediately deducted from your account balance. Your wins likewise will be immediately added to your Bingo Account balance.
You may only use real funds to play these games. Bingo Bonus funds (promotional or free money) are not available for the Instant Games. If you place a wager on an Instant Game and you have insufficient real funds cover your wager your wager will be voided.
Please remember that you have the option to play the Instant Games for FUN or for REAL MONEY.
We recognise that gambling can cause problems for a minority of gamers.

Bank of America’s Mobile Banking service incorporates the convenience you want with industry-leading safety and security features that provide peace of mind. We’ve also assembled some common-sense steps you can take to protect yourself and the important information on your mobile device.
Our security guarantee
We're committed to making Mobile BankingFootnote 1 safe and secure. Your Mobile Banking activities are protected by our Online Banking Security Guarantee, which covers the security of your Bank of America accounts, the security of your information and the time processing of your payments.Footnote 2 Learn more about our Online Banking Security Guarantee
Secure access to your accounts
When using our Mobile Banking applicationsFootnote 1 you're protected by these security features:
* SiteKey® image for verification of your identity and an extra layer of security.
* SafePass® security is available in the Mobile Banking App, just as it is in Online Banking
* Advanced encryption technology to prevent unauthorized access
* Privacy protection of your financial information as detailed in our U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice
Text Banking
By using Bank of America Text Banking, you can get quick access to balance and transaction information without exchanging personal information such as your full account number, PIN or email address.Footnote 3 Learn more about Text Banking
#1-rated safety features
Our customer safety features have ranked #1 for 7 years in a row by Javelin Strategy & Research, the nation's leading provider of research on financial institutions.
Secure technology
Our fraud prevention and security systems protect you with the latest encryption technology and secure email communications.
Update your mobile devices
Mobile devices are essentially small computers with software that needs to be kept up to date just like on a PC or laptop. Make sure all the mobile devices in your house have the latest security protection. This may require updating your devices with a computer.
Guard your personal information
Protect your phone or tablet device just as you would your computer. Secure your mobile device by using a strong passcode and be cautious about the sites you visit and the information you release.
Think before you app
Before you download an application (app) on your device, review the privacy policy and understand what specific data the app can access.
Protect your money
When banking and shopping on your mobile device, check to be sure the sites are secure. Look for web addresses with https: in the address. This means the site takes extra measures to help secure your information.
When in doubt, don't respond
Fraudulent texting, calling and voicemails are on the rise. Just like in fraudulent email, requests for personal information or a call for immediate action are almost always a scam.
Stay informed
Follow mobile security issues in the news and discuss them with friends, family and colleagues. Explore online resources like the Identity Theft Assistance Center and Microsoft® Security At Home websites that provide comprehensive information about topics such as identity theft and safe online behavior. View additional resources
Fake Mobile Banking apps
Criminals may develop and publish fake mobile banking applications that look like official Bank of America apps but are in truth designed to steal your Online Banking credentials. Here are tips for recognizing an unofficial Bank of America app:
* The developer or author of the application is not Bank of America
* The app is being promoted on a third-party site, somewhere other than the official app store for your mobile device
* There is a charge for downloading the app—Bank of America does not currently charge for mobile app downloads
To help protect your accounts and information, never download or install a Bank of America Mobile Banking app if you spot any of these warning signs.
SMShing is phishing that happens via SMS text message. A criminal sends you a text message that tries to trick you into replying with financial or personal information or clicking on links that will sneak viruses onto your mobile device. Don’t respond to a text message that requests personal or financial information. Bank of America will never ask you to provide your information in this way.
Lost and stolen devices
Mobile phones and tablet devices offer convenience, but they're also easy to lose or steal, which can put your information at risk. Here are some ways you can protect yourself now in the event your device is lost or stolen later:
* Password-protect your device so it can’t be accessed unless the password is entered
* Enable an automatic screen-locking mechanism to lock the device when it’s not actively being used
* Consider using a remote wipe program that gives you the ability to send a command to your device that will delete any data
* Keep a record of the device’s make, model and serial number in case it’s stolen
Traditional online threats
Viruses, malware and other programs intended to steal your personal information or financial details are able to infect some mobile devices. If your tablet supports a traditional anti-virus product, consider installing that software. Backup the device's data and keep the copy in a safe and secure location. This will allow you to restore your data in the event you need to wipe the device clean in order to remove a harmful software threat.

It’s your Web. At Yahoo!, we strive to make your experience on the Web as
customized an experience as it can be. This means you
can easily get the information that's most important to you - catch the score on your favorite team, see the
up-to-the-second news you need, get the financial
information that pertains to you—and see
ads that interest you.
How we customize your Yahoo! experience
We look at a person's browsing activity, such as the types of
content the person accessed, ads the person clicked, and searches the person conducted.
Based on this, we infer certain interests the person has, and we show
ads likely to meet the person's needs. For example, for people who like to check out the golf
scores on Yahoo! Sports, we may show ads that focus on
golf-related products and services.
We offer this service not just on the Yahoo! network
but across our partners’ sites as well.
Advertising is how we’re able to offer the innovative,
free services that are traditional at Yahoo!. As we
continue to customize your Yahoo! experience, you may
see ads that more closely reflect your interests.
We take your privacy seriously
Trust is one of Yahoo!’s core values. We’re committed to
providing you a secure browsing experience and
transparent policies showing how we use your information to
enhance your browsing experience.
Read our Privacy Policy.
Exercise your choice to decline ad matching
We also offer people who do not want this customized experience
the ability to opt out of ad matching (also known as behavioral advertising or
ad customization). If you opt out, you will still see ads, but the advertising you see
will be less customized to your interests. Learn more and exercise your choice.
If you have a Yahoo! ID, you can make your opt-out persistent, meaning that
your decision to opt out will be effective even if you clear your cookies, change
browsers, or use a different computer. More about
this feature.
Yahoo! also has a policy to de-identify search user log data (the records we keep about searches on our site) within 18 months of collection with limited exceptions to meet legal obligations. Other data we collect will be retained for a longer period in order to power innovative product development, provide personalized experiences, and better enable our security systems to detect and defend against fraudulent activity.More about this policy.
Frequently Asked Questions
Why do you customize my experience on Yahoo!?
Customization features are designed to bring you the
news, weather, or other content you want, and to help
you find what you are looking for more efficiently.
More
Where does Yahoo! show me customized ads?
We show them to you when you are on Yahoo! and when you visit some of our partner sites.
Can I opt out of receiving customized advertising?
Yes, you can. If you have a Yahoo! ID, you can also make your opt-out persistent. Learn more about this feature.
You can also choose to clear your cookies through a setting in your browser. Learn how.

Whenever you post content (like a status update, photo or check-in), you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience.
To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can see it.
Although you choose with whom you share, there may be ways for others to determine information about you. For example, if you hide your birthday so no one can see it on your timeline, but friends post happy birthday! on your timeline, people may determine your birthday.
Whenever you add things to your timeline you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience.
When someone tags you in a story (such as a photo, status update or check-in), you can choose whether you want that story to appear on your timeline. You can either approve each story individually or approve all stories by your friends. If you approve a story and later change your mind, you can remove it from your timeline. Learn more about tagging.
Finding you on Facebook
Your settings do not control whether people can find you or a link to your timeline when they search for content they have permission to see, like a photo or other story in which you've been tagged.
Once you share information with your friends and others, they may be able to sync it with or access it via their mobile phones and other devices. For example, if you share a photo on Facebook, someone viewing that photo could save it using Facebook tools or by other methods offered by their device or browser. Similarly, if you share your contact information with someone or invite someone to an event, they may be able to use Facebook or third-party applications or devices to sync that information. Or, if one of your friends has a Facebook application on one of their devices, your information (such as the things you post or photos you share) may be stored on or accessed by their device.
Activity log
Your activity log is a place where you can go to view most of your information on Facebook, including things you've hidden from your timeline. You can use this log to manage your content. For example, you can do things like delete stories, change the audience of your stories or stop an application from publishing to your timeline on your behalf.
When you hide something from your timeline, you are not deleting it. This means that the story may be visible elsewhere, like in your friends' News Feed. If you want to delete a story you posted, choose the delete option.
Anyone can add a link to a story. Links are references to something on the Internet; anything from a website to a Page or timeline on Facebook. For example, if you are writing a story, you might include a link to a blog you are referencing or a link to the blogger's Facebook timeline. If someone clicks on a link to another person's timeline, they'll only see the things that they are allowed to see.
A tag is a special type of link to someone's timeline that suggests that the tagged person add your story to their timeline. In cases where the tagged person isn't included in the audience of the story, it will add them so they can see it. Anyone can tag you in anything. Once you are tagged, you and your friends will be able to see it (such as in News Feed or in search).
Social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust. Learn more.
As described in the What your friends and others share about you section of this policy, your friends and others may share information about you. They may share photos or other information about you and tag you in their posts. If you do not like a particular post, tell them or report the post.
Groups
Once you are in a Group, anyone in that Group can add you to a subgroup. When someone adds you to a Group, you will be listed as invited until you visit the Group. You can always leave a Group, which will prevent others from adding you to it again.
Pages
Because Pages are public, information you share with a Page is public information. This means, for example, that if you post a comment on a Page, that comment may be used by the Page owner off Facebook, and anyone can see it. Learn more.
Page administrators may have access to insights data, which will tell them generally about the people that visit their Page (as opposed to information about specific people). They may also know when you've made a connection to their Page because you've liked their Page or posted a comment.

Advertising, Analytics, and Privacy
AOL’s websites, products, and services are supported in large part by advertising. This is how we are able to provide content and services. AOL owns an advertising network, AOL Advertising, that spans AOL owned and operated pages as well as many other websites across the Internet.
AOL may display various types of advertisements (such as banner ads, rich media ads, and sponsored links) on the sites you visit for a variety of reasons. In the same way that we use information about you (see “AOL Information”) to customize or personalize the content or services we provide, we may also use information to make the ads you see more relevant for you, and more effective for advertisers. We may also use information from other companies or sites to assist in determining the effectiveness of advertising. This helps advertisers spend their money wisely and helps the providers of content (publishers) increase revenues and stay online.
Often, an ad you see online is customized based on the content of the site. For example, in such contextual ads, you may see sports-related ads on a sports site. We may also select an ad based on our knowledge of the audience we think may be looking at that page. This is often done with publicly available and/or aggregated demographic information, or it may be done with analysis of the aggregated traffic on a particular website, or by using the registration data or other household data you have provided or that we have acquired from other companies (your “AOL Information” as defined in the Privacy Policy).
AOL may share certain information about you as a user (such as age, zip code, or other household information AOL has collected or received) with certain ad networks and service providers, including AOL Advertising, to help deliver more relevant content and advertisements throughout their networks. AOL takes steps to ensure that the information provided to ad networks is not personally identifiable, but instead provides attributes which are linked to a non-personally identifiable cookie or user ID.
Ad networks, including AOL Advertising, also provide ads to you on AOL Services and across their advertising networks. In some cases, these ads are based on your activity on those sites or information appended from offline sources. This is often called behavioral advertising, behavioral targeting, interest-based advertising, or customized ads. When you visit sites on the AOL Advertising network, you may receive a “cookie” or other technology that helps us note, in an anonymized way, that you visited that site. This information goes into ad logs that are kept for a limited duration. From the ad logs, AOL Advertising may use information about your activity to help us display ads that are more relevant. Note that the information shared with advertising networks is always with a unique identifier, and does not include personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, etc.
The following third party advertisers and service providers may use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies in connection with advertising, content, and services offered through AOL Services and other sites, including providing analytics services or helping to operate ad networks. The use of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies by AOL Advertising and other content and ad network providers is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. Click on the links below to learn more about their practices and the choices they provide to you. We may update this list of third-party providers from time to time, so you should review this supplement and the AOL Privacy Policy periodically.
* AOL Advertising
* Flurry
* Google Analytics
* Omniture
* Scorecard Research
* Session M
* Taboola
* Tapad
AOL and our advertisers may use additional service providers not listed above. Please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance for additional information about online advertising where many additional third party providers may be listed.
Consumer Control
While it is not possible to turn off all advertising, you do have the ability with respect to some of these companies to control whether or not advertising is customized based on your behavior.
You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from AOL Advertising when you browse the web by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer choice page and selecting AOL Advertising. Please note that your opt-out choice will apply only to the browser and device you are using when you opt out. You can make your choice apply to any browser and device you use while signed into AOL by adjusting your AOL Marketing Preferences.
You can learn how to opt-out of receiving targeted ads from AOL Advertising in mobile apps at Mobile Device Choices.
AOL is committed to complying with the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and with the Network Advertising Initiative’s Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct. Users can find out more about interest-based advertising on the websites of these organizations.
In addition, you can use your browser to control your experience. When you clear the cookies in your browser, you may clear the information used to build a behavioral profile. Depending on the browser you are using, you can also choose to block third party cookies (such as cookies from ad networks) or browse in a private browsing mode. As new technologies emerge to control your experience, we may provide additional information or instructions to manage your preferences.
Opt-Out Durability
Many opt outs are based on a cookie set by your browser that prevents the collection of data connected to a unique anonymous ID. If you opt-out using this method, the opt-out will generally last for 1-5 years. Please note that clearing the cookies in your browser may cancel the opt-out. In conjunction with the Digital Advertising Alliance, we offer the Cookie Protector, which will ensure that your opt-out settings persist regardless of clearing your cookies.

Ad Serving
Yahoo Privacy Policy > Yahoo Privacy Policy > Ad Serving
Relevant Advertising
Personalized Content
Yahoo may show content that may be personalized for you based on topics and other interests that you declare or are inferred about you. You may view and edit these topics on your Content Preferences page.
Yahoo! displays ads both on our network of owned and operated websites, such as the sites on the Yahoo.com domain and sites like Flickr.com and others (see our Acquired Companies page for a list of other domains where Yahoo! may serve ads) and on non-Yahoo! websites. Yahoo!’s network includes the Yahoo! Network Plus and Yahoo! Search Marketing. Yahoo! serves display ads, also known as graphical ads, which appear as images, animation or video. Yahoo! also serves text ads that appear as text links. Yahoo!’s Right Media Exchange and, in some markets, its APT technology platforms (“the Exchanges”) provide the means for advertisers, agencies, publishers and ad networks to manage their advertising business.
When you visit one of Yahoo!’s websites, or a non-Yahoo! website where Yahoo! may serve ads, ads that you see may be suggested by Yahoo! based on various factors such as the content of the page on which they appear, information you provide such as your gender, age or location, searches you conduct, what your friends or contacts recommend to you, or based on your other interests. Yahoo! may use information you provide, including personally identifiable information, to tailor ads when you are on one of our websites or using one of our services. Yahoo! may also analyze your use of our products and services and your engagement with the ads we show you. You can control Yahoo!’s use of this information for ad selection and improving the effectiveness of the Exchanges by opting out. To learn more about your options and to control this practice, click here.
Technologies Used
* Yahoo! uses tools called cookies and web beacons in the ad serving process. Click each link to learn more.
Ad Selection
* Ads served by Yahoo! may be customized to reflect your interests. To do this, Yahoo! may consider browsing activity, including the type of content accessed, ads clicked, and searches conducted or on related terms. Yahoo! may also use information about the ads you have seen and clicked on to improve the effectiveness of our Exchanges.
* When showing you ads on a search results page, information about your browsing behavior and your search query may be used to display more relevant ads. For more information about how your search queries may be used to display more relevant ads, visit the Yahoo! Search privacy page.
* Yahoo! may display ads based on relevant content. For instance, if you are viewing a Yahoo! news article about a recently released album, Yahoo! may show you an ad for a music store that sells albums. Similarly, ads in Yahoo! Finance may be related to financial services.
* Yahoo! may also tailor ads based on location. For more information about how Yahoo! uses location information, please visit our Yahoo! Location privacy page.
* Yahoo! may use information you provide, such as your gender, age or job category, to tailor ads when you are logged in or if you have stored this information with a Yahoo! service. Yahoo! may also use this information, including personally identifiable information, to tailor ads when you are on one of our websites or using one of our services.
* Yahoo! may tailor ads to you based on people you have connected with and their demonstrated or declared interests.
* Yahoo! may show ads suggested by friends or contacts.
* Yahoo! does not provide any personally identifiable information to an advertiser or website when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you should be aware that the advertiser may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
Transparency, Choice and Opt-out
* Yahoo! is transparent about how we serve ads. Yahoo offers you the following choices with regard to interest-based advertising:
* Please visit our Opt-Out page to learn more about the information used to personalize your ad experience and your choices regarding how we use information about these activities to influence the ads we show you. If you opt-out, you will continue to see ads Yahoo! serves on these websites, but they won’t be customized to your interests or search history.
* You can also opt-out of allowing other advertisers, agencies, networks or publishers use of the Right Media Exchange to select ads. Visit the Right Media Exchange Privacy Policy to learn more about how the Right Media Exchange operates and the privacy choices it provides.
* You can see and, in many cases, opt-out of, receiving targeted ads from other companies that serve ads on Yahoo! by visiting our Third Parties on Yahoo! page.
* You can edit your Yahoo! account information that may be used to select ads at any time.
* Yahoo is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to its code of conduct. Learn more about other NAI member ad serving companies and opt-out from each of them at the NAI website.
* Yahoo! is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), a cooperative of companies committed to building responsible advertising policies across the Internet, and adheres to the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Yahoo! is committed to delivering you enhanced privacy notices for online advertising on our branded websites. Yahoo!'s enhanced privacy notices appear both near the ad (AdChoices) and near the Privacy Policy link (About Our Ads). To learn more about enhanced privacy notices, other ad serving companies' privacy practices and opt-out from each of them, please visit the DAA website.

Etsy Guidelines
Etsy is a marketplace where people around the world connect to buy and sell unique goods.
Everything on Etsy must be Handmade, Vintage, or a Craft Supply
Handmade items are designed and created by the shops that sell them. Because transparency matters on Etsy, we ask sellers to list shop members and share information about manufacturers involved in creating their items. Reselling an item you were not involved in creating is not allowed in our handmade category.
Vintage items are 20 years or older and must not violate our rules for prohibited items.
Craft Supplies are materials and tools intended for use in the creation of a new handmade item.
Prohibited items, services, and items that violate our intellectual property policies are not allowed on Etsy.
Etsy Shops are Independent Businesses
Anyone over the age of 18 can open a shop on Etsy. Younger shop owners may be allowed in certain circumstances.
Etsy shops have their own policies, payment methods, and shipping and fulfillment methods. Shops on Etsy must meet Etsy’s standards of customer service and honor their shop’s policies. In the unlikely event that a transaction does not go as planned, the buyer and seller should work together to reach a resolution. If they can’t reach a resolution, they can use Etsy’s case system.
Honesty is important to Etsy and our community. We ask that shop owners represent themselves, their business, and their items accurately.
Learn more about buying and selling on Etsy in our Seller Guidelines, Buyer Guidelines, and Community Guidelines.
Etsy’s Trust and Safety team may reach out to shops in violation of these guidelines. While we prefer to help you bring your shop into compliance with our rules, Etsy may close shops that do not comply.
We reserve the right to remove listings that aren’t in the letter or spirit of Etsy’s guidelines. Learn more about Etsy’s mission and values.

Billing Policy
Etsy offers two plans for paying your bill: manual and automatic bill payment.
AutoBilling: The following terms apply if you are eligible and enrolled in the automatic payment plan (“AutoBilling”).
* You authorize Etsy to keep your payment card information on file and to charge the card on file on the first day of each calendar month for the previous month's outstanding charges, and at any time the balance of fees reaches the designated fee threshold for your account. Upon enrollment, Etsy will charge the card on file with the current balance.
* When your card account is debited, you will receive an email from Etsy to the email address on file letting you know the amount charged. You can also review this information by accessing your account on the Etsy site.
* If your card account on file with us is closed or the account number is changed, or if, for any reason, a charge is rejected by your card issuer, you must update your card information or supply a new card number, as appropriate, in your Etsy account. If your charge is refused by the issuer for any reason, you may be subject to penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination. Your authorization applies to any successor or replacement card you provide.
* You may cancel AutoBilling and revert to manual billing by updating your billing setting in your Etsy account. Etsy requires a reasonable period of time to act after we receive your notice. This means that an additional automatic payment may be made to your card account while we are processing your request.
* Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay Etsy for all unpaid fees per our Terms of Use.
Manual Billing: If your account is not enrolled in AutoBilling, then at the beginning of the month, Etsy will send an invoice to the seller’s email address on file detailing the amount due for the prior month’s fees and services. The seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the date of the invoice, or the account will be considered past due.

The Google Books settlement and privacy
Posted by Dan Clancy, Engineering Director for Google Books
Last year, we signed a settlement agreement with authors and publishers that, if approved by the court, will unlock access to millions of books for anyone in the US. We reached another important milestone a few weeks ago, as University of Texas and University of Wisconsin-Madison announced new agreements with Google to broaden access to their collections under the settlement.
Recently, we've heard questions about our agreement and what it will mean for user privacy. Privacy is important to us, and we know it's important to our users, too. We have a strong privacy policy in place now for Google Books and for all Google products. But our settlement agreement hasn't yet been approved by the court, and the services authorized by the agreement haven't been built or even designed yet. That means it's very difficult (if not impossible) to draft a detailed privacy policy. While we know that our eventual product will build in privacy protections -- like always giving users clear information about privacy, and choices about what if any data they share when they use our services -- we don't yet know exactly how this all will work. We do know that whatever we ultimately build will protect readers' privacy rights, upholding the standards set long ago by booksellers and by the libraries whose collections are being opened to the public through this settlement.
We're thinking hard about how best to build privacy protections into the products authorized under the settlement. We've been having ongoing discussions with a wide range of privacy advocates, and we look forward to talking more with them and others throughout the industry about how to protect the privacy of people who search, browse, and buy books online.
Privacy organizations and Google have a lot to agree on: expanded, free online access to library books should be supported by continued privacy protections for readers. You can read our initial thoughts on how to do so in our FAQ. To read more about privacy at Google, visit our Privacy Center, and stay tuned for more details as we have them.

Referrals, redirections, and cookies
Referrals and redirections
The settings in Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Network determine how Web servers handle and monitor your Internet activities, as described below.
Send referrer informationSome Web sites register the site that referred you to them. This information can be used to tailor content based on the site that you came from. If you prefer not to allow a Web site to know where you were before visiting it, especially if you were on a local, secure, or restricted site, uncheck this option to disable it. Note, however, that some sites depend on referrer logging internally.Enable automatic redirectionSometimes a site might redirect your browser to a different URL, often because the site has moved. Leaving this option enabled does not constitute a big security risk, but turn it off if you want complete control of what sites you visit.
Cookies are pieces of information stored in files that Web servers store on your computer when you are browsing. These pieces of information allow servers to recognize your computer the next time you visit their sites. Cookies are not viruses and cannot cause direct damage to your computer system in any way, but they may record your browsing habits in intrusive manners and trace your movements across different Web sites.
Some sites use cookies to store your username, for example, so that you do not have to retype your password when you check your e-mail for a number hours after you log in. This is convenient, but it can also be a security hazard if others have access to the computer you are using.
Delete cookies
To ensure that cookie information is kept in the browser, select Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Cookies and check Delete new cookies when exiting Opera and close Opera when you have finished browsing.
Enable or disable cookies
You may also decide that you want to disable cookies. Note, however, that you may have difficulties logging on to a significant amount of Web sites if you disable cookies. To disable cookes, select Settings > Quick Preferences and uncheck Enable Cookies.
Invalid cookies
There are types of cookies that Opera will refuse regardless of whether you have set the browser up to handle all cookies. These are cookies set for top-level domains: domains ending in .com, .net, and .org, among others. Such cookies are considered invalid or illegal and are blocked because:
* Any Web site could read such a cookie's contents, it would have unlimited access.

Let website visitors know that you can be trusted
with their personal information.
Customers choose to do business with companies they trust.
92% of consumers are concerned about privacy and 89% avoid doing business with companies they don't trust.*
*TRUSTe / Harris 2014 Consumer Confidence Index
Your website is often the first chance you will have to make an impression with your customers. Assure customers they can trust you with their data when they visit your website by demonstrating you respect their privacy and that your data privacy management practices are up to a vigorous set of standards with TRUSTed Websites.
Benefits
* Improve Compliance - Reduce the legal risks associated with meeting complex data privacy management requirements
* Protect Brand - Protect your brand from negative media coverage due to privacy issues
* Build Trust - Build trust with users, clients, business partners, and regulators by demonstrating your commitment to protecting customer data
* Maximize Resources - Save time and expense associated with hiring extra legal and operations resources to assess and manage your privacy practices
Key Features
TRUSTed Websites privacy certifications follow a comprehensive and proven multi-step process to ensure your privacy practices meet applicable regulatory and industry standards.
Data Collection and Discovery
TRUSTed Websites privacy certifications begin with a review of your data privacy management practices for each website you want to certify. We work with you to identify a range of information including what data you collect, how you use it, who you share it with, third party agreements, use of trackers, privacy disclosures, opt-outs, and much more. We also review your stated privacy practices and policies. The TRUSTe team uses a combination of methodologies including a manual evaluation of your privacy practices by our team of privacy analysts, company interviews and on-site engagements, and digital property scanning tools.
Digital Property Scanning Tools
TRUSTe will apply our proprietary scanning technology to the applicable websites and mobile apps, providing comprehensive insight into the variety of data collection activities happening throughout your site and apps. The scan will uncover what could take dozens to hundreds of hours to accomplish manually with internal resources. You’ll find the first and third party trackers with detailed information about them including identity, location, type of tracker and URL. The scan will also shed light into the tracking technologies used, and the entire chain of tracker source (“daisy chain”). You will also get a scoring and evaluation of third party tracker severity, using a proprietary algorithm that calculates its Privacy Sensitivity Index (PSI). It will also provide insights into personally identifiable information (PII) data collection.
Privacy Findings Report & Gap Analysis
We present you with a Privacy Findings Report summarizing a gap analysis between your privacy practices and the TRUSTed Websites Privacy Program Requirements along with the changes you need to make to your data privacy management practices and privacy policies to achieve certification. Our Privacy Program Requirements are built upon the core principles of transparency, choice and accountability and they provide a comprehensive set of requirements based on applicable privacy regulations, industry self-regulatory requirements, and industry best practices.
Privacy Statement Validation
We validate that your new website privacy statement accurately reflects your privacy practices and is consistent with our Privacy Program Requirements.
Certified Privacy Seal
Once we validate that you've implemented the changes outlined in the Privacy Findings Report, you get access to the TRUSTed Website Privacy Seal. The seal is recognized globally as a high standard for privacy management and displayed on thousands of websites and apps. You can display the seal both on your privacy statement as well as in other prominent places like your website home page and site footer to demonstrate your commitment to privacy. The seal is hosted by TRUSTe and linked to a TRUSTe Validation Page to provide real-time verification that your website certification is current and valid.
Letter of Attestation
Once certification is complete, you can request a letter of attestation that your company is a TRUSTe client that has undergone a review and alignment with TRUSTe’s program requirements. This attestation can be shared with your business partners as part of RFPs and other process reviews, providing competitive differentiation.
Privacy Dispute Resolution Service
TRUSTe also offers a third-party dispute resolution service, which helps you efficiently manage privacy inquiries from customers. It also addresses the dispute handling requirements for regulatory programs like the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework.
Ongoing Privacy Monitoring
The core Data Tracker Scanning technology used in your initial certification is used periodically to help you monitor the ongoing privacy risk for your certified websites. The automated service can also include validation checks to alert you when something unexpected appears or if when needed content or functionality are not found.
Ongoing Privacy Guidance
TRUSTed Websites also provides you with access to ongoing privacy guidance as it relates to your TRUSTe certification, including new regulations, product plans, geographic expansion, and acquisitions. You’ll get access to TRUSTe Privacy Solutions experts along with Educational Webinars, Seminars, White Papers, and Research Reports.

As part of our commitment to keeping your account and personal information safe and secure, we’ve assembled some useful tips for spotting fraudulent email.
Phishing and spoofing
Phishing and spoofing emails look like official Bank of America emails and try to trick you into visiting a fake website and providing your personal account information. These emails may also ask you to call a phone number and provide account information. See an example of a fraudulent email
Ways to identify phishing and spoofing emails include:
* Links that appear to be Bank of America links but aren’t. If you place your cursor over a link in a suspicious email, your email program most likely shows you the destination URL. Do not click the link, but look closely at the URL: A URL that is formatted bankofamerica.fakewebsite.com is taking you to a location on fakewebsite.com. Just because “bankofamerica” is part of the URL does not guarantee that the site is an official Bank of America site.
* Requests for personal information. Bank of America emails will never ask you to reply in an email with any personal information such as your Social Security number, ATM or PIN.
* Urgent appeals. We will never claim your account may be closed if you fail to confirm, verify or authenticate your personal information via email.
* Messages about system and security updates. We will never claim the need to confirm important information via email due to system upgrades.
* Offers that sound too good to be true. We will never ask you to fill out a customer service survey in exchange for money, then ask you to provide your account number so you can receive the money.
* Obvious typos and other errors. These are often the mark of fraudulent emails and websites. Be on the lookout for typos or grammatical errors, awkward writing and poor visual design.
If you receive a suspicious email that uses Bank of America’s name, forward it to us immediately at abuse@bankofamerica.com.

When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies for storing information to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience and for advertising purposes.
This page is designed to help you understand more about these technologies and our use of them on our sites and in our services, applications, and tools. Below is a summary of a few key things you should know about our use of such technologies. You can review the contents of our full User Cookie Notice below.
Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent).You are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device permits so. You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.
Where possible, security measures are set in place to prevent unauthorized access to our cookies and similar technologies. A unique identifier ensures that only we and/or our authorized service providers have access to cookie data.
Service providers are companies that help us with various aspects of our business, such as site operations, services, applications, advertisements and tools. We use some authorized service providers to help us to serve you relevant ads on our services and other places on the internet. These service providers may also place cookies on your device via our services (third party cookies). They may also collect information that helps them identify your device, such as IP-address or other unique or device identifiers.
What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?
Like most sites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools.
The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand this Policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the following limited terminology and definitions:
Cookies – Small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. There are several types of cookies:
* Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.
* Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.
* First-party cookies are set by the site you are visiting
* Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.
Cookies can be disabled or removed by tools that are available in most commercial browsers. The preferences for each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options.
Web beacons - Small graphic images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) that may be included on our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.
Similar technologies – Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.
We may use the terms “cookies” or “similar technologies” interchangeably in our policies to refer to all technologies that we may use to store data in your browser or device or that collect information or help us identify you in the manner described above.
Your choice and our use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies
We offer certain site features, services, applications, and tools that are available only through the use of these technologies. You are always free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your browser, installed application, or device so permits. However, if you decline cookies or other similar technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain site features, services, applications, or tools. You may also be required to re-enter your password more frequently during your browsing session. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable these technologies, please review your browser or device settings.
Generally, these technologies allow our sites, services, applications, and tools to store relevant information in your browser or device and later read that information in order to identify you to our servers or internal systems. Where applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is designed for interpretation only by us. We do not store any of your personal information on any of our cookies or other similar technologies.
Any personal information that we collect and store through use of these technologies is first obtained through notice and consent: We obtain your consent by providing you with transparent notice of use of the technologies and providing you with the opportunity to make a choice to disable these technologies as set forth above.
Our uses of such technologies fall into the following general categories:
* Operationally Necessary. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our sites, services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our sites, services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;
* Performance Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our websites, applications, services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our websites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services, or tools;
* Functionality Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our sites, services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our sites;
* Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our sites or on third party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that have been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.
Depending on which eBay Inc. website you visit, we may offer you the ability to opt-out of our use of first-party advertising-related cookies through our Ad Choice program. To opt-out of the use of third-party advertising-related cookies and web beacons, see the section ‘Ad Networks and Exchanges operated by authorized third parties’ below. Opting out of our first-party advertising-related cookies, or out of third-party advertising-related cookies and web beacons as described below, does not necessarily mean that you will not see our advertising - only that this advertising will not be targeted to you through the use of first-party or third-party cookies, web beacons or related technologies.
If you would like to opt-out of all other types of technologies we employ on our sites, services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.
Use of these technologies by authorized third-party service providers
We may work with third-party companies, commonly known as service providers, who are authorized to place third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies for storing information on our sites or in our services, applications, and tools with our permission. These service providers help us to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience.
These service providers may use these technologies to help us deliver our own content and advertising, and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We do not permit any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information on our sites or in our services, applications, or tools for their own purposes. These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions on their use or collection of any personal information. Third party cookies are covered by the third-parties’ privacy policy.
With the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or other authorized third-parties, we do not permit any third-party content on sites (such as item listings, member-to-member communications, classified listings, comments, reviews, etc.) to include or utilize any cookies, web beacons, local storage, or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to collect your personal information. If you believe a listing or other third-party content might be collecting personal information or using tracking technologies on one of our sites, please report it to spam@eBay.com.
Ad networks and exchanges operated by authorized third parties
We may use third parties, such as advertising networks and exchanges, to allow us to serve you advertisements. These third-party ad networks and exchange providers may use third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information. They may also collect your device identifier, IP address, or identifier for advertising (IDFA). The information that these third parties collect may be used to assist us in providing you with more relevant advertising that we serve on our sites or elsewhere on the web. Third party cookies are covered by the third-parties’ privacy policy.
For more information on third-party advertising-related cookies and how to opt-out of them, please visit on of the following third party websites:
* Your Online Choices
* About Ads (only available in English)
* Network Advertising Initiative (only available in English)
“Do Not Track”
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.

* Hide The Online Privacy Notice has been updated; have your privacy practices changed?
No, they have not. Bank of America strives to be an industry leader in transparency in terms of online data collection and use. We review our notice at least annually to ensure it continues to align with our practices and provides clear and current information on how we use information collected from or about you. The updated notice reflects the results of our recent review.
* Show Do you use cookies?
Yes, cookies allow us to remember you, to enhance your experience on our site and to offer you relevant products and services. We use cookies to facilitate site navigation, to monitor responses to our advertisements, and to continually improve our website design and functionality for our account holders and visitors.
* Show Can I choose not to accept cookies?
Yes. But, if you choose not to accept cookies from our Sites, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Site or benefit from the information and services offered. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that may be relevant to your individual interests and needs.
* Show Do you use Flash objects?
Yes, Flash objects are used as part of our solutions for online authentication to help us recognize you and your device when you come back to our site. We also use Flash objects to determine your browser type and version of Adobe® Flash® in order for you to view our demos and tutorials with moving content.
* Show Can I delete Flash objects?
Yes. But, if you choose to delete Flash objects from our Sites, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Site or benefit from the information and services offered.
* Show What is relationship based advertising?
Relationship-based advertising helps us provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. These advertisements and offers are based on the type of relationship you have with us, for example: If you’re a checking customer, we might present you with a special offer for reordering checks.
* Show What is online behavioral advertising?
Online behavioral advertising helps us provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Here’s how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites that’s customized to meet specific interests you may have.
* Show Why does Bank of America use Online Behavioral Advertising?
Online behavioral advertising helps us provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful.
* Show Can I opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising?
Yes. If you prefer that we not use information about your online Site activities to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail), you can opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us. Remember that your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for opt outs to work.
* Show Can I opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising on other sites?
On third-party sites where we advertise, Bank of America uses the Advertising Options Icon on our behavioral ads (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). Anyone receiving a behavioral ad may click on the displayed icon to receive more information and can opt out at that time or by visiting the third-party site's privacy policy for an opt out mechanism.
You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt Out Tool or other tools provided by the publishing platform.
Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive untailored online advertising from Bank of America. Opting out from a specific third-party site means that the ads you receive will not be tailored based on your choices or behavior. Remember that your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for opt outs to work, and if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again.

WordPress.com and WordPress.org
WordPress is a publishing platform that makes it easy for anyone to publish online, and proudly powers millions of websites. It comes in two flavors: the fully hosted WordPress.com, and the self-hosted version available at WordPress.org.
WordPress.com
Focus on your beautiful content, and let us handle the rest. WordPress.org
Get your hands dirty, and host your website yourself.
Premium hosting, security, and backups are included. You can even upgrade to a custom domain, like YourGroovyDomain.com. You’ll need to find a host, and perform backups and maintenance yourself. We offer VaultPress for security and backups.
Choose from hundreds of beautiful themes. Make it your own with Custom Design. Install custom themes. Build your own with PHP and CSS.
Integrate your site with Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and other social networks. Install a plugin, like Jetpack, to enable sharing functionality on your site.
Popular features like sharing, stats, comments, and polls are included. There’s no need to install plugins. Install plugins to extend your site’s functionality.
Personal support and the WordPress.com forums are always available. Visit the WordPress.org support forums for assistance.
You must register for an account on WordPress.com and abide by our Terms of Service. No registration with WordPress.org is required.
WordPress is a community-driven project that’s developed by and for people like you. Many thousands of people from around the world contribute to the project, and many millions of websites are powered by it. From large company websites to personal blogs, and everything in between, everyone can publish with WordPress.
There are two ways that you can get started with WordPress. You can host a WordPress installation on your own server, or you can host your site here at WordPress.com and let us handle the technical bits.
Hosting your own WordPress site can be fun and rewarding, but it also requires some technical knowledge and places more responsibility on you, the publisher. You can download the WordPress software for free at http://wordpress.org, but it must be installed on a web server before it will work. You will need to research and install your own themes and plugins. Many hosting providers offer a one-click installation of WordPress — here are a few examples. If you’re looking for a web development agency that specializes in building beautiful WordPress sites, check out the CodePoet Directory.
WordPress.com is different. Here at WordPress.com, you don’t have to download software, pay for hosting, or manage a web server. You can instead focus on creating wonderful content, and let us handle the rest!
WordPress.com is a great choice for bloggers, photographers, artists, plumbers, doctors, restaurateurs — almost anyone. However, techies that prefer to maintain full control over their code, should consider hosting their own WordPress installation. We provide a large number of themes and built-in plugin functionality so you won’t need to upload your own.
Publishing your website is always free here at WordPress.com. And many excellent premium upgrades are available to help you supercharge your site. These upgrades let you use a custom domain (like YourGroovyDomain.com), extensively customize the appearance of your site, upload HD video, and lots more.
WordPress.com is a commercial enterprise owned by Automattic, a company started by the founding developer of WordPress and staffed by full-time developers, designers, and support engineers. Automatticians (employees of Automattic) regularly contribute back to the WordPress software so that the entire community can benefit.
Not sure which way to go? Find out more about WordPress.com and WordPress.org to see which is best-suited for you.

TRUSTe Program Requirements
Background
TRUSTe’s Truste Privacy Programs provide cutting-edge consumer protections and establish leading privacy standards. Each certification program has unique Program Requirements tailored to the platform (like mobile apps) and/or applicable regulatory frameworks (like COPPA). Our Program Requirements are the standard against which we evaluate and certify a company's online privacy practices and these requirements embody our mission to promote transparency, accountability and choice in the collection and use of personal information. Certified companies that display our privacy seal demonstrate compliance with our Program Requirements and their commitment to privacy protection, instilling confidence and trust in users of their products and services.
TRUSTe’s Program Requirements incorporate principles from privacy frameworks established by APEC, the OECD, and the FTC and also reflect input from consumers, clients, advocates and regulators. Privacy, like technology, continually evolves and we closely monitor privacy developments in the public and private sector and amend our Program Requirements as needed. We work hand-in-hand with our clients to implement new Program Requirements, ensuring that they can confidently deploy state-of-the-art products and services while maintaining strong privacy protections.

It seems that one Comcast rep has decided on a brilliant new way to retain customers - never let them leave. That would most likely be confirmed by Ryan Block, the co-founder of tech site Engadget (pictured), who found himself enduring a torturous 18 minute interrogation of a phone call with a barking Comcast employee who demanded to know why he wanted to choose another cable provider. Comcast subsequently apologised for the incident (tweet pictured bottom).

The trio - Michael Horrigan, 29, his roommate Tristan Kading, 28, and his sister Emily Kading, 26 - pleaded not guilty this week to hurling beer bottles and shouted expletives at security officers patrolling the star's seaside property. However it has now been revealed they are all well-to-do twenty-somethings, who claim they were 'just drinking and it got out of hand'. Tristan Kading studied chemical oceanography, graduating from MIT, while sister Emily Kading is a nuclear scientist studying to be a nuclear physicist. Both Tristan and Michael Horrigan have been given citations for heroism after saving a 12-year-old girl after her canoe capsized.

A suicidal South Carolina man was sentenced to life in prison for killing his bedridden wife and their nine-year-old granddaughter, saying he wanted to spare them the pain of living without him. Ronald Gregory, (right) shot his wife, 71-year-old Barbara Gregory, and his granddaughter Mia Rodgers, (pictured center) as they slept in the early hours of March 21. Gregory told detectives that Mia survived for an hour, but instead of calling for help, Gregory held Mia as she bled to death, prosecutor Kevin Brackett said. The prosecutor recounted some of the girl's last words as people in the courtroom gasped and sobbed Monday. 'Paw paw, when am I going to stop hurting?' Brackett said, quoting the girl.

Someone somewhere is now the proud owner of a rare American Sherman tank after paying $299,000 for it this weekend at an auction of more than 100 tanks and military vehicles amassed by a Silicon Valley tycoon. Jacques Littlefield’s collection, one of the nation’s most extensive and historic, was sold in the San Francisco Bay Area during one of the largest-ever auctions of military vehicles (including a Scud missile, top left and a British Rapier missile system, top right). Bidders from 10 countries and 37 U.S. states bought nearly all of the 122 military vehicles - some of which are operational and require a federal permit to own - on auction, generating $10.24 million in sales, according to Auctions America, which ran the auction on Friday and Saturday, on behalf of the Collings Foundation.

Angelique now says she deeply regrets her words, which she claims she said on the spur of the moment. She added she believes he was high on PCP when he shot dead the hero officer. And after a memorial for Campbell sparked outrage as it glamorized 'Thugs' and was bigger than that for Officer Santiago, she said she has a 'right to mourn'.

A type of online fraud in which a criminal sends email that appears to be from a legitimate source, but in fact is designed to entice the recipient into clicking a link to a website where the unsuspecting victim is asked to provide sensitive personal information. That information can subsequently be used for identity theft purposes. A typical phishing scam involves an email from a bank or a popular online company telling trhe recipient that there is an account problem that needs to be addressed. (Additional information on phishing can be found on the sites listed on our External Resources page.)
Privacy breach
A privacy breach is a situation in which sensitive information that is controlled by Bank of America (or a third party acting on our behalf) is lost, misused (including inappropriately accessed) or disclosed to an unauthorized third party. The information may be in any form, including paper, electronic and encrypted data. A privacy breach may occur within Bank of America or at a supplier working on behalf of Bank of America.
Privacy notice
The policy under which a company operating a website handles personal information collected about visitors to the site. View the Bank of America online privacy notice
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

Service pack
A software program, sometimes referred to as a patch, that corrects known problems or adds new features to a software program already installed on your computer.
Skimming
Stealing credit card information during an otherwise legitimate transaction. Skimming occurs when the information thief photocopies credit card receipts or uses a small electronic device added to a credit card scanner to capture card numbers and security codes.
SMShing
The mobile phone version of phishing. An example of SMShing fraud would be a text message that appears to be sent from a legitimate source, such as a bank or credit card company, that urgently requests the recipient to call a phone number or follow a link in the message. The phone number or website will then ask for sensitive account or personal information.
Spam
Unsolicited email or text messages sent to large numbers of people to promote products or services. Federal legislation known as CAN-SPAM Act sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives customers the right to stop receiving email and spells out tough penalties for violations. Learn more about CAN-SPAM
Spoofing
An online identity theft scam in which criminals send emails that appear to be sent from legitimate sources. Also known as phishing, spoofing most often refers to the specific component of the scam in which elements of the email are made to appear legitimate. For example, the “From” address in the email may appear legitimate when in fact it is not.
Spyware
A type of malware that gathers information from your computer activities and sends it to an unknown source without your knowledge. Spyware programs can be particularly damaging when they are designed to capture personal and financial information that can be used to commit fraud.
Trojan horse
A seemingly legitimate piece of software that carries an unwanted bit of programming code that can be used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to your computer.
Virus
A malicious program or piece of programming code. A virus can can transmitted in a variety of ways, including being copied from one device to another through an infected thumb drive or being transmitted through an infected email attachment. Viruses can be as harmless as delivering a birthday message or as destructive as causing your hard drive to be reformatted.
Vishing
A form of phishing that occurs over VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) connections. In a vishing scam, a person receives a phone call that appears to be coming from a legitimate source such as a bank or credit card company. The caller identification on the victim’s phone will show a legitimate business name and number, when in fact a criminal is really making the call. The criminal will pose as a representative of the company and ask the victim to confirm account details and other sensitive information, thereby illegally obtaining sensitive financial and personal information that can be fraudulently used.
Worm
A worm is a form of malware that reproduces itself in order to spread to other computers on a network. A malicious worm will typically use up computer resources with the intention of shutting down the entire system.
Zombie
A computer that has been maliciously accessed and set up as part of a botnet.

Common Methods Fraudsters Use
Fraudulent emails (phishing)
Phishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company. This is known as a phish email.
In the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable company’s website. Fraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal information can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.
Use caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link. These emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud. Never open attachments, click links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown senders. If you receive a suspicious email that appears to be from Wells Fargo, report it and delete it.
How fraudsters obtain email addresses
Fraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email lists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.
If you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Wells Fargo, this does not mean that Wells Fargo’s computer systems have been breached.
Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)
Fraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect a phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.
Text-message phishing (smishing)
A phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or device. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing. The purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince recipients to share their confidential information.
Never take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account numbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. If you receive a text message expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or verify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information, on a website, do not respond and delete it. These messages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your confidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.
Telephone or voice phishing (vishing)
Known as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone call or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear that the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have identifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call appear more authentic.
If you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, ask for the purpose of the call and then hang up. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone numbers found on the company’s website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM, debit or credit card.
Paper mail or fax phishing
Some fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information. Phishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about a piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should discard it. If you responded to a suspicious mailing or fax and provided confidential information, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source such as the phone number listed on the company's website, billing statement, or on the back of your ATM, debit or credit card to determine if your information was compromised.
Pop-up windows
Fraudsters may use pop-up windows – small windows or ads – to obtain personal information. These windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers or music-sharing software. If you encounter a suspicious pop-up window, close it. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid downloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software on your computer.

Vimeo Cookie Policy
Last Updated: January 2013
Vimeo uses cookies on Vimeo.com and related domains and applications (the “Vimeo Service”). By using the Vimeo Service, you consent to the use of cookies. If you are embedding the Vimeo video player on your website, you should make appropriate disclosures about cookies to your users.
This Cookie Policy is part of our Privacy Policy and explains:
* What cookies are
* What cookies are used when you use the Vimeo Service
* How third parties use cookies on the Vimeo Service
* Your cookie options
* Further cookie resources
1. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that allows Vimeo or a third party to recognize you. Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (1) to enable certain functions; (2) to provide analytics; (3) to store your preferences; and (4) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.
Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years. Cookies placed by the website you’re visiting are sometimes called “first party cookies,” while cookies placed by other companies are sometimes called “third party cookies.”
2. What cookies are used when I use the Vimeo Service?
When you use the Vimeo Service or visit a webpage with a Vimeo video, Vimeo or a third party may place a number of cookies in your browser. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list. We update this list quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that aren’t yet listed.
Each cookie serves one of four different purposes:
Category
1. Essential cookies
These first party cookies allow you to use a feature of the Vimeo Service, such as:
* Staying logged in
* Viewing a private video or album
* Watching videos in Couch mode
* Making purchases
2. Analytics cookies
These cookies track information about how the Vimeo Service is being used so that we can make improvements and report our performance. We might also use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them. Analytics cookies may either be first party cookies or third party cookies.
3. Preference Cookies
These first party cookies store your Vimeo Service preferences, such as:
* Language preference
* Volume preference
* HD mode preference
4. Ad targeting cookies
These third party cookies are placed by advertising platforms or networks in order to:
* Deliver ads and track ad performance
* Enable advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your activities (this is sometimes called “behavioral” or “targeted” advertising)
3. How do third parties use cookies on the Vimeo Service?
Third party companies like analytics companies and ad networks generally use cookies to collect user information on an anonymous basis. They may use that information to build a profile of your activities on the Vimeo Service and other websites that you’ve visited. You can learn more about how these companies use your information by visiting the privacy policies listed in our cookie list.
4. What are my cookie options?
If you don’t like the idea of cookies or certain types of cookies, you can change your browser’s settings to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies. To learn more about how to do this, visit the help pages of your browser. Please note, however, that if you delete cookies or do not accept them, you might not be able to use all of the features we offer, you may not be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.
You may also opt out of third party cookies by following the instructions provided by each third party in its privacy policy. Please see our cookie list for links to the third party privacy policies. Some third party ad networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). You can visit the NAI’s website to find out how to opt out of members’ cookies.
5. Do you use any other user tracking technologies?
We use additional technologies to help track user activities and preferences. For example, we use web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs). Web beacons are tiny graphics (about the size of period) with a unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on web pages or emails. They are used to track user activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web beacons used in webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only. Finally, we use local storage to facilitate certain functions, but we do not retain the data captured via local storage.
6. Where can I find more information about cookies?
You may learn more about cookies and how to opt out of them by visiting the following third party websites:
* About.com Browser Guide
* All About Cookies.org
* Network Advertising Initiative

When it comes to keeping your personal and financial information safe, it’s important to be proactive. Follow these tips to help protect yourself from fraud and identity theft.
Protect your identity
Safeguard your personal and financial information so that it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.
Identity Protection Tips
* Carry only necessary information with you. Leave your Social Security card and unused credits cards at home in a safe and secure location.
* Do not provide your Social Security number unless absolutely necessary.
* Make photocopies (front and back) of vital information you carry regularly and store them in a secure place, such as a safety deposit box. Then, if your purse or wallet is lost or stolen, you have contact information and account numbers readily available.
* If you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the purpose of the call. Then contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone numbers found on the company’s website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM, debit or credit card.
* Never provide payment information on a call that you did not initiate.
* Replace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions, if offered by your employer, bank, utility provider or merchant.
* If you have free online account access with Wells Fargo Online® or Wells Fargo Business Online® Banking, you can reduce paper statements by signing up for Bill Pay and free online statements.
* Shred documents containing personal or financial information before discarding. Many fraud and identity theft incidents happen as a result of mail and garbage theft.
* Review your credit report at least once a year to look for suspicious or unknown transactions. You can get a free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus at www.annualcreditreport.com. Get a copy at any time directly from:
* Equifax: 1-800-685-1111 or www.equifax.com
* Experian: 1-888-397-3742 or www.experian.com
* TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800 or www.transunion.com
* Subscribe to a daily credit monitoring service, such as Wells Fargo Identity Theft Protection, which includes a personal credit report and quarterly updates from up to all three major credit bureaus. (Restrictions and fees apply; refer to terms and conditions.)
* Promptly retrieve incoming mail and place outgoing mail in a U.S. Postal Service mailbox, instead of your home mailbox, to reduce the chance of mail theft. Consider paperless options for your bills and financial statements.
* Know your billing and statement cycles. Contact the company’s customer service department if you stop receiving your regular bill or statement.
Protect your accounts
There are many steps you can take to secure your checking, credit card, and debit card accounts. These tips can help get you started.
Checking Account Security Tips
* Report lost or stolen cards and checks immediately.
* Review account statements carefully. Regular account review helps to quickly detect and stop fraudulent activity. Ask about suspicious charges.
* With Wells Fargo Online® or Wells Fargo Business Online® Banking, you can monitor your account online any time and as frequently as you like.
* Limit the amount of information on checks. Don’t print your driver license number or Social Security number on your checks.
* Store new and cancelled checks in a safe and secure location.
* Carry your checkbook with you only when necessary.
* Use tamper-resistant checks. Wells Fargo checks include many safety features such as tamper-resistant packaging and chemically sensitive paper to deter alterations.
Credit Card and Debit Card Security Tips
* Always keep your credit or debit card in a safe and secure place. Treat it as you would cash or checks. Contact Wells Fargo immediately at 1-800-T0-WELLS (1-800-869-3557) if your card is lost or stolen, or if you suspect unauthorized use.
* Do not send your card number through email, as it is typically not secure.
* Do not give out your card number over the phone unless you initiated the call.
* Regularly review your account statements as soon as you receive them to verify transactions. Contact Wells Fargo immediately if you identify any discrepancies.
* If you have forgotten your PIN or would like to select a new one, please visit your nearest Wells Fargo location.
* To protect your account, Wells Fargo recommends you change your Personal Identification Number (PIN) every six months.
* When selecting a PIN, don’t use a number or word that appears in your wallet, such as name, birth date, or phone number.
* Ensure no one sees your PIN when you enter it. Memorize your PIN. Don’t write it down anywhere, especially on your card, and never share it with anyone.
* Cancel and cut up unused credit and other cards. If you receive a replacement card, destroy your old card.
* Shop with merchants you know and trust.
* Make sure any internet purchase is secured with encryption to protect your account information. Look for secure transaction symbols such as a lock symbol in the lower right-hand corner of your web browser, or “https://…” in the address bar of the website. The “s” indicates secured and means the web page uses encryption.
* Always log off from any website after a purchase transaction is made with your credit or debit card. If you cannot log off, shut down your browser to prevent unauthorized access to your account information.
* Safe-keep or securely dispose of your transaction receipts.
Be safe online and on your mobile device
Whether you’re sending emails, shopping online, using social media, or just surfing the Web, it’s important to keep your account information and identity secure. Follow these tips to avoid compromising your information.
Online Security Tips
* Do not use your Social Security number as a username or password.
* Change your usernames and passwords regularly and use combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters such as # and @. Do not use your Wells Fargo online banking username and password for other online accounts or activities.
* To change your Wells Fargo username or password:
* Sign on to an online banking session.
* Click on the Account Services tab.
* Under My Profile, select Change Username or Change Password.
* Protect your online passwords. Don’t write them down or share them with anyone.
* Protect your answers to security questions. Do not write down or share your answers with anyone. Wells Fargo will never ask you to provide answers to security questions via email.
* Use secure websites for transactions and shopping. Shop with merchants you trust. Make sure internet purchases are secured with encryption to protect your account. Look for secure transaction signs like a lock symbol in the lower right-hand corner of your browser or “https” in the address bar.
* Social media is increasingly popular, but it's a good idea to keep certain personal information private. Avoid sharing personal details that are used by financial institutions to identify you, such as your birth date, home address, mother’s maiden name, schools attended/mascots and pet’s name. Fraudsters may use this type of information to help gain access to an account since they are common answers to security questions.
* Always carefully review the privacy options for any social network you join. The privacy options and tools for social networks can be complex and should be reviewed carefully so that there is no disclosure of information you meant to remain private.
Email Security Tips
* Be wary of suspicious emails. Never open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown senders. Learn more about fraudulent emails.
* If you receive a suspicious email that you think is a phish, do not respond or provide any information. Send the email to reportphish@wellsfargo.com.
* If you respond to a phish email with personal or account information, contact 1-866-867-5568.
Mobile Security Tips
When you use a mobile device for browser or text-based account access, keep these tips in mind:
* Use the keypad lock or phone lock function on your mobile device when it is not in use. These functions password-protect your device to make it more difficult for someone else to view your information.
* Frequently delete text messages from your financial institution, especially before loaning out, discarding, or selling your mobile device.
* Keep your account numbers, passwords, Social Security number and date of birth private. Never share your personal or financial information in a text message, phone call or email.
* If you lose your mobile device or change your mobile phone number, sign on to Wells Fargo Online® to remove the old number from your mobile banking profile or call customer service at 1-866-863-6762.
* Avoid storing your banking password or other sensitive information on your smartphone or in an app where it could be discovered if your phone is stolen.
* When you finish banking online, always log off. Wells Fargo's smartphones apps, iPad apps and mobile banking site will automatically log you off after 10 minutes of inactivity. This reduces the risk of others accessing your information from your device.
* Keep your mobile operating system up to date to ensure the highest level of protection. Before downloading an update to your mobile device be sure to go to the company’s website to confirm the update is legitimate.
* Be cautious when using public hotspots. Carefully consider your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection settings, even at a trusted retailer, as fraudsters can spoof the name of reputable hotspots.
Applications are programs you can download to your mobile device. Applications or “apps” that let you monitor your finances and conduct certain transactions are increasing in popularity.
* Download banking applications from reputable sources only to ensure the safety of your account information. Download the Wells Fargo app by searching “Wells Fargo” in your phone’s app store, or visit wf.com on your phone's browser.
* For your security, sign off when you finish using a Wells Fargo app rather than just closing it.
* If you have suspicions about the authenticity of a Wells Fargo mobile banking app, access your account through our mobile banking site at wf.com.
QR codes (quick response codes) are two-dimensional barcodes that can be scanned with a mobile device to provide easy access to online information. Much like links in email, QR codes can be used by fraudsters to send you to websites that may request your personal and financial information or could corrupt your mobile device.
* Treat QR codes with the same suspicion as you would any URL or link you find in an email.
* Use caution on which QR codes to scan, as some may have been tampered with if placed in a public place.
* Use a QR code scanner from a reputable source that will check links for malicious content. This capability can be found in the app description before downloading.
Computer Security Tips
* Avoid downloading programs from unknown sources.
* Ensure your computer operating system, software, browser version and plug-ins are current. Before downloading an update to your computer program, first go to the company’s website to confirm the update is legitimate.
* Install a personal firewall on your computer and keep anti-virus software installed and updated.
* Be wary of conducting online banking activities on computers that are shared by others. Public computers should be used with caution. Online banking activities and viewing or downloading documents (statements, etc.) should be conducted, when possible, on a computer you know to be safe and secure.
* Configure your devices to prevent unauthorized users from remotely accessing your devices or home network. For example, if you use a home wireless router for your home internet connection, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations to configure the router with appropriate security settings.
